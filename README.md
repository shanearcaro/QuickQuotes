# QuickQuotes

This is the second project in my journey to learn Android Development with Kotlin. I've decided that I'm going to try and do everything in a more technical way. For this, I am trying my best to avoid looking anything up or getting carried away with features early on. I want to learn Android Development to its fullest.

Also: Although I normally use Linux I have been using Windows 10 with WSL installed on it to complete all these projects. Although Android Studio has a built-in tool for Version Control, I am going to be using WSL because I prefer working with Linux. Some of the commits are not secure and this is because gpg has a problem with wsl and ssh commits for some reason. There is a work around that I found but it is not persistant. I've set up a .bashrc_alias command to take care of this for me so I guess I'll see how that goes.
